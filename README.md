## üîå Decal Integration

### How It Works
1. ThwargZone detects your Decal installation via Windows Registry
2. Launches the AC client in suspended mode
3. Injects the Decal DLL into the process
4. Resumes the game with Decal loaded

### Requirements
- Decal must be properly installed and registered in the Windows Registry
- Compatible Decal version for your AC client
- Registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Decal\Decal`

### Troubleshooting
If Decal injection fails:
1. Verify Decal is properly installed
2. Run ThwargZone as Administrator
3. Check that your antivirus isn't blocking the injection
4. Ensure Decal is compatible with your AC client version

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

- Passwords are stored using .NET's built-in settings encryption
- No data is transmitted to third parties (except fetching public server lists)
- All game credentials are passed directly to the AC client
- Decal injection uses standard Windows process injection techniques

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Game Won't Launch
- Verify your AC client path is correct
- Ensure `acclient.exe` exists at the configured location
- Check that you have a server, account, and password configured

### Decal Injection Fails
- Try running ThwargZone as Administrator
- Verify Decal is installed correctly
- Check Windows Registry for Decal installation
- Disable antivirus temporarily to test

### Server List Not Loading
- Check your internet connection
- Verify firewall isn't blocking HTTP requests
- Server list URL may be temporarily unavailable

### Window Positions Not Saving
- Check that the application has write permissions to `%LOCALAPPDATA%`
- Try running as Administrator
